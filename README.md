QuickAlarm
==========

Android app to set alarms quickly.

To fill the gap of no alarm / reminder apps have a quick, simple way to set an alarm/countdown by an offset alone.
Will keep a history of past alarms enabling the user to kick off an old countdown easily.

Plan to include countdown widgets (possibly auto generated, depends on permissions).



All open source, not that anyone else probably wants this....
